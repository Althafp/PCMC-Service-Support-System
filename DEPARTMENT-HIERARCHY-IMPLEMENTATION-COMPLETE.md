# ✅ Department-Based Hierarchy - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION

## 🎯 **What Was Implemented**

Your project now has a **complete department-based hierarchy** where:
- Managers can have multiple departments
- Managers select which department to work in after login
- All manager actions are scoped to the selected department
- Admin view shows: Manager → Departments → Technicians

---

## 📊 **New Structure**

```
Manager A (assigned to: Field, DC, Operations)
  ↓ (Logs in)
  ↓ (Selects "Field Department")
  ↓
Field Department Context
  ├─ Teams in Field Department
  │   ├─ Team 1
  │   └─ Team 2
  ├─ Technicians in Field Department
  ├─ Reports from Field Department
  └─ Analytics for Field Department

(Can switch to "DC Department" anytime)
```
