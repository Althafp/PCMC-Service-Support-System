# 📋 Draft & Report Flow Implementation Guide

## ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!**

All features from your specification have been implemented successfully.

---

## 🎯 **What Was Implemented**

### **1. Automatic Complaint Number Generation**
- ✅ New reports auto-generate: `COMP-{timestamp}`
- ✅ Example: `COMP-1736520456789`

### **2. Draft System**
- ✅ Draft complaint numbers: `DRAFT-{userId}-{timestamp}`
- ✅ Example: `DRAFT-abc123-1736520456789`
- ✅ Drafts are private (only creator can see)
- ✅ Back button confirmation modal with "Save as Draft" option

### **3. Draft Management**
- ✅ New Drafts page at `/technician/drafts`
- ✅ View all saved drafts
- ✅ Continue editing drafts
- ✅ Delete drafts
- ✅ Draft statistics

### **4. Sequential Numbering on Approval**
- ✅ Team Leader approval assigns sequential numbers
- ✅ Format: `COMP-00001`, `COMP-00002`, `COMP-00003`...
- ✅ Replaces temporary/user-entered complaint numbers

### **5. Privacy & Filtering**
- ✅ MyReports: Excludes drafts (shows only submitted/approved/rejected)
- ✅ Team Leader views: Excludes drafts
- ✅ Manager views: Excludes drafts
- ✅ Admin views: Excludes drafts
- ✅ Only technician who created draft can see it

### **6. UI Improvements**
- ✅ Dashboard shows "My Drafts" quick action with count
- ✅ Enhanced progress indicators
- ✅ Workflow information display
- ✅ Draft mode indicator

---

## 🚀 **Deployment Steps**

### **Step 1: Setup Sequential Numbering in Database**

Run the SQL file in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```bash
# Open Supabase Dashboard
# Go to: SQL Editor → New Query
# Copy and paste the contents of: setup-sequential-numbering.sql
# Click "Run"
```

**What this does:**
- Creates `complaint_number_counter` table
- Creates `get_next_complaint_number()` function
- Sets up indexes for performance
- Initializes counter at 0

### **Step 2: Verify Database Setup**

Run this test query in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Test the function
SELECT get_next_complaint_number(); -- Should return COMP-00001
SELECT get_next_complaint_number(); -- Should return COMP-00002

-- Check counter
SELECT * FROM complaint_number_counter;
```

If you see `COMP-00001` and `COMP-00002`, it's working! ✅

### **Step 3: Deploy Frontend Changes**

The following files have been created/updated:

**New Files:**
- `src/pages/technician/Drafts.tsx` - Draft management page
- `setup-sequential-numbering.sql` - Database setup script

**Updated Files:**
- `src/pages/technician/EnhancedNewReport.tsx` - Draft flow & auto-numbering
- `src/pages/technician/MyReports.tsx` - Exclude drafts filter
- `src/pages/technician/TechnicianDashboard.tsx` - Added Drafts link
- `src/pages/team-leader/ReportApprovalList.tsx` - Exclude drafts
- `src/pages/team-leader/TeamReports.tsx` - Exclude drafts
- `src/pages/team-leader/EnhancedReportApproval.tsx` - Sequential numbering
- `src/pages/manager/ReportsOverview.tsx` - Exclude drafts
- `src/pages/admin/ReportsManagement.tsx` - Exclude drafts
- `src/App.tsx` - Added Drafts route

Build and deploy:

```bash
npm run build
# Deploy the dist folder to your hosting
```

## 🎬 **How It Works - User Flow**

### **Scenario 1: Create and Submit Directly**

1. Technician clicks "New Report"
   - System auto-generates: `COMP-1736520456789`

2. Technician fills all 6 steps and clicks "Submit Report"
   - Status: `submitted`
   - Complaint #: `COMP-1736520456789` (unchanged)

3. Team Leader reviews and clicks "Approve Report"
   - System calls `get_next_complaint_number()`
   - Complaint # changes to: `COMP-00001` ✅
   - Status: `approved`

### **Scenario 2: Save as Draft**

1. Technician clicks "New Report"
   - System auto-generates: `COMP-1736520456789`

2. Technician fills Steps 1-3, then clicks Back Button
   - Modal appears: "Are you sure to go back?"
   - Options: [Discard] [Save as Draft] [Cancel]

3. Technician clicks "Save as Draft"
   - Complaint # changes to: `DRAFT-{userId}-1736520456789`
   - Saved to database with status: `draft`
   - Redirected to Drafts page

4. Later, technician opens Drafts and clicks "Continue"
   - Form loads with saved data
   - Technician can change complaint # if desired
   - Completes remaining steps

5. Technician clicks "Submit Report"
   - Updates existing record (no duplicate)
   - Status changes to: `submitted`
   - User's complaint # preserved (e.g., `COMP-12345`)

6. Team Leader approves
   - System assigns: `COMP-00002`
   - Replaces `COMP-12345`

## 📊 **Database Schema Changes**

### **New Table: complaint_number_counter**
```sql
id (INTEGER) - Always 1
current_number (INTEGER) - Increments with each approval
updated_at (TIMESTAMPTZ) - Last update time
```

### **New Function: get_next_complaint_number()**
```sql
Returns: TEXT (e.g., 'COMP-00001')
Thread-safe: Yes (uses UPDATE...RETURNING)
```

---

## 🔧 **Configuration & Customization**

### **Change Sequential Number Format**

Edit in `setup-sequential-numbering.sql`:

```sql
-- Current: COMP-00001 (5 digits)
formatted_num := 'COMP-' || LPAD(next_num::TEXT, 5, '0');

-- Change to 6 digits: COMP-000001
formatted_num := 'COMP-' || LPAD(next_num::TEXT, 6, '0');

-- Change prefix: RPT-00001
formatted_num := 'RPT-' || LPAD(next_num::TEXT, 5, '0');
```

### **Reset Counter (if needed)**

```sql
UPDATE complaint_number_counter SET current_number = 0 WHERE id = 1;
```

### **Set Counter to Specific Value**

```sql
-- Start from 100
UPDATE complaint_number_counter SET current_number = 99 WHERE id = 1;
-- Next number will be COMP-00100
```

---

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **Issue: "Error assigning complaint number"**
**Solution:** Run `setup-sequential-numbering.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor

### **Issue: Drafts still showing in Team Leader view**
**Solution:** Clear browser cache and reload. Check filter: `.neq('status', 'draft')`

### **Issue: Duplicate complaint numbers**
**Solution:** Sequential numbers are unique. If you see duplicates, it's from manually entered numbers before approval.

### **Issue: Draft saved but not appearing in Drafts page**
**Solution:** 
- Check if status is exactly 'draft' (lowercase)
- Verify technician_id matches logged-in user
- Check browser console for errors

---

## 📈 **Future Enhancements (Optional)**

- [ ] Export drafts as JSON for backup
- [ ] Auto-save drafts every 30 seconds
- [ ] Draft expiration (auto-delete after 30 days)
- [ ] Bulk delete old drafts
- [ ] Draft templates for common report types
- [ ] Collaborative drafts (share with team members)

## 📝 **Important Notes**

1. **Sequential numbers are ONLY assigned on approval** - This ensures only official, approved reports get sequential numbers.

2. **Drafts are completely private** - Only the creating technician can see their drafts.

3. **Updating existing draft** - When continuing a draft, the system updates the existing record, preventing duplicates.

4. **Thread-safe counter** - Multiple approvals happening simultaneously won't cause number conflicts.

5. **Audit trail preserved** - All changes to complaint numbers are logged in audit_logs table.

---
