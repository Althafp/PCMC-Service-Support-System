## **Issue 4: Sequential Numbering** ✅ VERIFIED

### **Status:**
Code is correct! Just needs database setup.

**Make sure you ran:**
```sql

setup-sequential-numbering.sql
```

**Test it:**
```sql
SELECT get_next_complaint_number();
-- Should return: COMP-00001
```

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **If Signature Still Not Showing:**

**Step 1: Check Database**
```sql
SELECT signature FROM users WHERE id = '[your_id]';
```
- Should return: `data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KG...`
- If NULL: Draw and save signature again

**Step 2: Check Console**
- Look for ❌ red error messages
- Copy exact error message
- Check what step failed

**Step 3: Try Manual Draw**
- Open profile/report
- Draw signature manually
- See if manual signature stays

**Step 4: Check Canvas Element**
```
Inspect Element on canvas:
<canvas width="600" height="200">

Should have:
- width="600"
- height="200"
- Proper ref attached
```

**Step 5: Browser Compatibility**
- Use Chrome/Edge (best support)
- Enable JavaScript
- Clear cache completely
- Try incognito mode
