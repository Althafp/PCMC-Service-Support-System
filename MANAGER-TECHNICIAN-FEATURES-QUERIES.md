# üìä Manager & Technician Features - Database Queries Summary

## üéØ **Major Changes Overview**

### **Architectural Shift:**
- ‚ùå **OLD:** Manager-based hierarchy (filter by `manager_id`)
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Department-based hierarchy (filter by `department_id`)

---

## üë§ **MANAGER ROLE - Features & Queries**

### **1. Department Selection (Login Flow)**

**Feature:** Manager must select department after login

**Query:**
```sql
-- Fetch all departments manager has access to
SELECT 
  d.id,
  d.name,
  d.is_active
FROM manager_departments md
JOIN departments d ON md.department_id = d.id
WHERE md.manager_id = 'MANAGER_UUID'
  AND d.is_active = true
ORDER BY d.name;
```

**Tables Used:**
- `manager_departments` (junction table)
- `departments`

**Result:** Manager sees list of departments to choose from

---

### **2. Dashboard Statistics**

**Feature:** Shows team members, reports, and stats for selected department

**Query 1 - Get Team Members:**
```sql
-- Get ALL technicians/team leaders in selected department
SELECT 
  id,
  full_name,
  employee_id,
  role,
  mobile,
  zone,
  team_id,
  team_name,
  is_active
FROM users
WHERE department_id = 'SELECTED_DEPT_UUID'
  AND role IN ('technician', 'team_leader')
  AND is_active = true
ORDER BY full_name;
```

**Query 2 - Get Reports:**
```sql
-- Get reports from department members
SELECT 
  sr.*
FROM service_reports sr
WHERE sr.technician_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM users 
  WHERE department_id = 'SELECTED_DEPT_UUID'
  AND role IN ('technician', 'team_leader')
)
AND sr.status != 'draft'
ORDER BY sr.created_at DESC;
```

**OLD Query (WRONG):**
```sql
-- ‚ùå OLD: Filtered by manager_id
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE manager_id = 'MANAGER_UUID'
  AND department_id = 'DEPT_UUID';
```

**NEW Query (CORRECT):**
```sql
-- ‚úÖ NEW: Filters ONLY by department_id
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE department_id = 'DEPT_UUID'
  AND role IN ('technician', 'team_leader');
```

**Tables Used:**
- `users`
- `service_reports`

**Key Change:** No `manager_id` filter! Multiple managers can see same data.

## üéØ **CRITICAL QUERIES - Before vs After**

### **Manager Queries:**

| Feature | OLD Query | NEW Query |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Get Technicians | `WHERE manager_id = X AND department_id = Y` | `WHERE department_id = Y AND role IN (...)` |
| Get Teams | `WHERE manager_id = X` | `WHERE department_id = Y` |
| Get Reports | `WHERE technician_id IN (SELECT id WHERE manager_id = X)` | `WHERE technician_id IN (SELECT id WHERE department_id = Y)` |

### **Technician Queries:**

| Feature | Query Added |
|---------|-------------|
| Form Access Check | `SELECT is_enabled FROM department_forms WHERE department_id = X AND form_id = Y` |
| Auto Project Link | Trigger copies `users.project_id` to `service_reports.project_id` |

---

## üìã **SUMMARY**

### **Manager Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Department selection required at login
- ‚úÖ All queries filter by `department_id` (not `manager_id`)
- ‚úÖ Can see ALL members in department
- ‚úÖ Multiple managers can manage same department
- ‚úÖ Create users without setting `manager_id`

### **Technician Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Form access controlled by `department_forms` table
- ‚úÖ Reports auto-linked to technician's project
- ‚úÖ PDF displays project logo automatically
- ‚úÖ Drafts hidden from all other roles

### **Key Tables:**
- `users` - Primary user data
- `service_reports` - Report data
- `teams` - Team structure
- `department_forms` - Form access control
- `manager_departments` - Manager access control
- `projects` - Project data + logos

### **Query Pattern:**
```
OLD: Filter by manager_id ‚ùå
NEW: Filter by department_id ‚úÖ
```

---

## üöÄ **Result**

**Flexible, scalable, department-based system where:**
- Managers access departments (not own technicians)
- Technicians belong to departments (not specific managers)
- Reports inherit project logos automatically
- Form access controlled per department
- Multiple managers can collaborate on same department

**All features use department_id as primary filter!** üéØ
