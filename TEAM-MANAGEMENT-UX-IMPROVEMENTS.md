# Team Management UX Improvements

## ✅ Changes Completed

### **1. "Add Members" Button Functionality Fixed** ✅

**Problem:** 
- In the Edit Team modal, clicking "Add Member" was opening the Create User form
- This was confusing as users expected to add existing unassigned members

**Solution:**
- Created a new modal `showAddUnassignedMemberModal`
- Modal displays all unassigned members in the selected department
- Users can click "Add" button next to each member to add them to the team
- Team leaders are automatically converted to technicians when added

---

### **2. All Alert Notifications Removed** ✅

**Removed alert() from:**
- ✅ Team creation
- ✅ Team deletion
- ✅ Team updates
- ✅ Team leader assignment
- ✅ Member removal
- ✅ Member assignment
- ✅ Error messages
- ✅ Success messages

**Kept confirm() for:**
- ✅ Team deletion (important destructive action)
- ✅ Member removal (important destructive action)

All alerts have been replaced with console logging for debugging.

## 🔄 Workflow: Adding Member to Team

Edit Team → Add Member → Create User Form
(Confusing - user wanted to add existing members)
```

```
Edit Team → Add Member → Select from Unassigned Members
(Clear - shows exactly what's available)
```

### **Step-by-Step:**
1. Manager clicks "Edit Team" on a team card
2. In edit modal, clicks "Add Member" or "Add More Members"
3. New modal opens showing all unassigned members
4. Manager clicks "Add" next to desired member
5. Member is instantly added to team
6. Modal stays open so manager can add more members
7. Manager clicks "Close" when done
8. Returns to Edit Team modal with updated member list
